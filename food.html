                            <h1>Fish and Chips</h1>
                            <p>Fish and chips are a beloved Kiwi classic and a staple of New Zealand's coastal culture. Introduced by British settlers in the 19th century, this dish quickly became a local favourite and is now a must-try for visitors wanting to experience authentic Kiwi comfort food.
                            Typically, fresh fish like hoki, tarakihi, snapper, or gurnard is battered and deep-fried until golden and crispy, then served with thick-cut chips (fries). It's often wrapped in paper, perfect for enjoying at the beach, in a park, or as a casual takeaway meal. Popular condiments include tomato sauce, tartare sauce, or malt vinegar, and many locals love adding a side of pineapple fritters or battered sausages.
                            What makes New Zealand fish and chips special is the freshness of the seafood—caught locally and cooked to order. Coastal towns and cities across the country boast their own iconic fish and chip shops, often passed down through generations. Whether you're eating it on the waterfront with seagulls nearby or grabbing a quick meal after aday of exploring, fish and chips offer a delicious, no-fuss taste of everyday life in New Zealand.</p>

                            <p>Hokey pokey ice cream is one of New Zealand's most iconic and beloved desserts. This classic Kiwi flavour combines smooth, creamy vanilla ice cream with crunchy nuggets of honeycomb toffee, known as hokey pokey. The contrast between the soft ice cream and the golden, crackly toffee creates a texture and taste that's both nostalgic and uniquely New Zealand. First appearing in the mid-20th century, hokey pokey ice cream quickly became a national favourite. Today, it's a staple in nearly every dairy, supermarket, and ice cream shop across the country. Many New Zealanders grow up eating it, and it's often the first flavour they recommend to visitors. The toffee pieces are made from a simple mix of sugar, golden syrup, and baking soda, which puffs up to create the airy, caramel-like crunch. Though the ingredients are humble, the result is a flavour that's rich, sweet, and distinctly Kiwi. Whether you're enjoying a cone by the beach, grabbing a tub for a family barbecue, or trying it for the first time, hokey pokey ice cream is a must-try that captures the fun, laid-back spirit of New Zealand.</p>
